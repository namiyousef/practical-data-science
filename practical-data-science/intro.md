# Practical Data Science

This is a collection of practical notes for Data Scientists. It is best thought of as a handbook that can be used to quickly remind you of considerations that are practical in nature. They are based on industry experience and implementation. As a result, no theory is covered and knowledge of the underlying concepts will be assumed. Relevant resources are given where appropriate for a refresher.

My goal in writing this is to have a set of notes that I can revisit to remember things that I've learnt through practice when dealing with different types of problems and models.
